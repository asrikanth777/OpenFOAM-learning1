For this project, whats going to be done is an analysis using different turbulence models
-laminar
-kepsilon
-komegaSST

further experiments will be introduced afterwards.

UPDATE 29 OCTOBER 2025
- When running with kOmegaSST, the sim did not reach convergence and capped out at 2000s run time.
    + first approach is to refine the mesh, and make y+ smaller along the walls of the backward step.
